# Story Development Workflow

**Trigger:** Implementing a user story or feature from planning to completion

## Actions

### 1. Story Ready Check

Before starting development:
- [ ] Story has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies are identified
- [ ] Technical approach is understood
- [ ] Story is appropriately sized

### 2. Load Context

Gather relevant documents:
- Story requirements and acceptance criteria
- Related architecture documentation
- Tech spec for the epic/feature area
- Existing code patterns in the area

### 3. Implementation

For each acceptance criterion:
1. Understand the requirement
2. Implement the feature
3. Write tests for the AC
4. Mark task complete with evidence

Track progress:
- [ ] AC1: [Description]
- [ ] AC2: [Description]
- [ ] AC3: [Description]

### 4. Dev Notes

Document as you go:
- Key decisions made and why
- Deviations from original plan
- Technical debt introduced
- Questions that arose

### 5. Self-Review Before Submitting

Before marking ready for review:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria addressed
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] No debug code or console logs left
- [ ] File list updated with all changes

### 6. Story Done Checklist

Mark story complete when:
- [ ] All ACs implemented and tested
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No open blockers
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
