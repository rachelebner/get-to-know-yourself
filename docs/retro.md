# Project Retrospective & Insights

Accumulated learnings and reflections from building parallel questionnaire processing.

Focus only on workflow, process, usefulness of rules etc. Ignore the actual project's design and code.

## Session: 2026-01-28 - Project Kickoff

### What We Did
- Created worktree for isolated brainstorming
- Initialized spec.md with feature requirements and open questions
- Drafted design.md with three architectural options

### Decisions Made
- Using worktree instead of just branch to allow parallel work on main project
- Branch name: `ui/parallel-questionnaires`
- Starting as brainstorming/design phase before implementation

### Workflow Observations
- Worktree approach is good for exploratory work that might not merge
- Quick-ui-start workflow adapted well to brainstorming context

### Rule Candidates
- Consider adding "brainstorm mode" variant of quick-ui-start for design-first work
