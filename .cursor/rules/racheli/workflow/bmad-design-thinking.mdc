# Design Thinking Process

**Trigger:** Building something user-facing, need to understand users, or designing new features/products

## Actions

### 1. Define Challenge

Establish the design challenge:
- What problem or opportunity are you exploring?
- Who are the primary users or stakeholders?
- What constraints exist?
- What does success look like?

Create a clear **challenge statement** to guide the process.

### 2. EMPATHIZE - Build User Understanding

Methods to understand users:
- User interviews
- Observation / shadowing
- Surveys
- Empathy mapping

Gather insights on:
- What did users say, think, do, and feel?
- What pain points emerged?
- What surprised you?
- What patterns do you see?

### 3. DEFINE - Frame the Problem

Transform observations into actionable statements:

**Point of View (POV) Statement:**
> "[User type] needs [need] because [insight]"

**How Might We (HMW) Questions:**
- Open the solution space
- Example: "How might we make [pain point] easier?"

Ask:
- What's the REAL problem we're solving?
- Why does this matter to users?
- What assumptions are we making?

### 4. IDEATE - Generate Solutions

Divergent thinking phase:
- Generate 15-30 ideas minimum
- Build on others' ideas
- Go for wild AND practical
- Defer judgment

Select top concepts by asking:
- Which ideas excite you most?
- Which address the core user need?
- Which are feasible given constraints?

Pick 2-3 concepts to prototype.

### 5. PROTOTYPE - Make Ideas Tangible

Create low-fidelity prototypes:
- Paper sketches
- Wireframes
- Clickable mockups
- Physical models

Define what you're testing:
- What's the minimum to test assumptions?
- What should users be able to do?
- What can you fake vs build?

### 6. TEST - Validate with Users

Plan testing:
- Test with 5-7 users
- Define tasks they'll attempt
- Prepare questions to ask
- Plan how to capture feedback

Collect feedback:
- What worked well?
- Where did they struggle?
- What surprised them (and you)?
- What would they change?

Synthesize:
- What assumptions were validated/invalidated?
- What needs to change?
- What new insights emerged?

### 7. Plan Next Iteration

Based on testing:
- What refinements are needed?
- What's the priority action?
- How will you measure success?

Determine next cycle:
- Need more empathy work?
- Should you reframe the problem?
- Ready to refine prototype?
- Time to pilot with real users?


## Reminders

- Keep users at the center of every decision
- Prototype beats discussion - make ideas tangible quickly
- Embrace failure as feedback, not defeat
- Observe what users DO, not just what they SAY
- Never give time estimates - focus on what, not when
