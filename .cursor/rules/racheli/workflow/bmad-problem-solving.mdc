# Systematic Problem Solving

**Trigger:** Facing a complex problem, debugging issues, or need to find root causes

## Actions

### 1. Define the Problem

Before jumping to solutions, establish clarity:
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- How did you first notice this problem?
- Who is experiencing this problem?
- When and where does it occur?
- What's the impact or cost?
- What would success look like?

Create a **refined problem statement**:
- What EXACTLY is wrong?
- What's the gap between current and desired state?

### 2. Diagnose and Bound

Use **Is/Is Not Analysis** to map boundaries:

| Question | IS | IS NOT |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Where does it occur? | | |
| When does it happen? | | |
| Who is affected? | | |
| What is the problem? | | |

Identify patterns from these boundaries.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

Choose a method based on problem type:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Five Whys** | Linear cause chains |
| **Fishbone Diagram** | Complex multi-factor problems |
| **Systems Thinking** | Interconnected dynamics |

Keep drilling:
- What are the immediate symptoms?
- What causes those symptoms?
- What causes those causes?
- What's the root cause we must address?

### 4. Analyze Forces and Constraints

**Force Field Analysis:**
- What forces drive toward solving this?
- What forces resist solving this?
- Which forces are strongest?
- Which can we influence?

**Constraint Identification:**
- What's the primary bottleneck?
- What limits our solution space?
- What constraints are real vs assumed?

### 5. Generate Solution Options

Generate diverse alternatives:
- 10-15 solution ideas minimum
- Mix of incremental and breakthrough
- Include "wild" ideas that challenge assumptions

Methods:
- **Systematic:** TRIZ, Morphological Analysis
- **Creative:** Lateral Thinking, Assumption Busting, Reverse Brainstorming

### 6. Evaluate and Select

Define evaluation criteria:
- Effectiveness - Will it solve the root cause?
- Feasibility - Can we actually do this?
- Cost - What's the investment?
- Risk - What could go wrong?

Use a **Decision Matrix** to compare options:

| Solution | Effectiveness | Feasibility | Cost | Risk | Score |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------|------|-------|
| Option A | | | | | |
| Option B | | | | | |

Select optimal solution with clear rationale.

### 7. Plan Implementation

Define approach:
- Strategy: pilot, phased rollout, or big bang?
- Who needs to be involved?
- What dependencies exist?

Create action steps:
- [ ] Step 1 - [Owner]
- [ ] Step 2 - [Owner]
- [ ] Step 3 - [Owner]

### 8. Establish Monitoring

Define success metrics:
- What indicates success?
- What targets or thresholds?
- How frequently to review?

Plan for failure:
- What could go wrong?
- How to detect issues early?
- What's plan B?


## Reminders

- Diagnosis before jumping to solutions
- Balance rigor with momentum - don't get stuck in analysis
- Solutions without implementation plans remain theoretical
- Celebrate insights when they emerge
