# Brainstorming Session

**Trigger:** Need to generate ideas, explore possibilities, or solve creative challenges

## Actions

### 1. Session Setup

Define the brainstorming context:
- What topic or challenge are we brainstorming about?
- What constraints or parameters to keep in mind?
- Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation?

### 2. Choose Approach

Select one of these approaches:

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **User-Selected Techniques** | When you know what method you want |
| **AI-Recommended** | When you want suggestions based on context |
| **Random Technique** | For unexpected creative methods |
| **Progressive Flow** | Start broad, narrow systematically |

### 3. Technique Categories

If selecting techniques, consider these categories:

- **Structured** - Systematic frameworks (Mind Mapping, SCAMPER)
- **Creative** - Breakthrough thinking (Analogical Thinking, What-If Scenarios)
- **Deep** - Root cause and insight (Five Whys, First Principles)
- **Wild** - Push boundaries (Assumption Reversal, Forced Relationships)

### 4. Progressive Flow Patterns

Common technique sequences by goal:

| Goal | Sequence |
|------|----------|
| Problem-solving | Mind Mapping → Five Whys → Assumption Reversal |
| Innovation | What If Scenarios → Analogical Thinking → Forced Relationships |
| Strategy | First Principles → SCAMPER → Six Thinking Hats |

### 5. Facilitation Principles

During the session:
- Ask, don't tell - use questions to draw out ideas
- Build, don't judge - "Yes, and..." never "No, but..."
- Quantity over quality - aim for many ideas
- Defer judgment - evaluation comes later
- Monitor energy - check in periodically

### 6. Convergent Phase

When ready to consolidate:
- Review all generated ideas
- Identify patterns and group into categories
- Classify ideas as:
  - **Quick wins** - implement immediately
  - **Future innovations** - need more development
  - **Moonshots** - bold long-term pursuits

### 7. Action Planning

For top 3 priority ideas:
- Why is this a priority?
- What are the concrete next steps?
- What resources are needed?


## Reminders

- The facilitator guides you to generate ideas, not brainstorm for you
- Energy checkpoints keep momentum: "How are you feeling about this?"
- Session reflection captures what worked for future sessions
