# Quick UI Project - Cleanup

**Trigger:** Before finishing work, run this cleanup pass

## Code Review Checklist

### Remove Redundancies
- [ ] Duplicate code that can be extracted to shared functions
- [ ] Unused imports and variables
- [ ] Dead code paths
- [ ] Commented-out code (delete it, git has history)

### Reduce Bloat
- [ ] Overly complex abstractions for simple things
- [ ] Unnecessary wrapper components
- [ ] Over-engineered solutions
- [ ] Files that do too little (consider merging)

### Right-size Error Handling
- [ ] Remove excessive try/catch for things that won't fail
- [ ] Remove redundant null checks where TypeScript guarantees values
- [ ] Keep error handling proportional to actual risk
- [ ] User-facing errors should be helpful, not technical

### Code Quality
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Components are focused (single responsibility)
- [ ] No magic numbers/strings (extract to constants)
- [ ] CSS/styles are organized, no unused styles


## Update Documentation

After cleanup, update these files to reflect **current state**:

### `spec.md`
- Does it accurately describe what the app does NOW?
- Remove any features that were cut
- Add any features that were added
- Update user flows if they changed

### `design.md`
- Does the architecture section match the actual code?
- Are all key components documented?
- Remove references to approaches that were abandoned
- Add any new technical decisions

**Remember:** These files describe the system AS-IS, not its history.
